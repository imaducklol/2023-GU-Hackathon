# 2023-GU-Hackathon
A small text based game made in Rust where you traverse the GU campus.  
Made in 12 hours.  

# Building/Running:
This is a pretty standard rust project.  
`$ cargo run` should do the trick. 

# Note:
This was our first time using Rust, and the coding practices employed here do not necesarily represent what you should do!  
Maybe stay away from worldmaker.rs...
